# Aerial firefighting game

## Context
Beeing young, my mother developped a little game on an Amstrad computer of an aircraft that needs to put out a growing fire.

I decided to recreate the same game idea with pokemons.

## Controls
The aircraft moves by itself, you cannot control its movement.

At any time, you can drop different amount of water by pressing a key:
- Space: Drops a small unit of water
- L: Drops a big unit of water (equivalent of 3 small units)
- M: Drops three small units of water
